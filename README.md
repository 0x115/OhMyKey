Dumb keyboard press emulation
For one of my C # projects, I needed to emulate a keystroke. 
I googled this question, but I could not find a simple library for this. 
But, I found how to do it in C ++, and after 30 minutes I copied the code from different places, like StackOverflow, and I got a simple .dll to emulate a key press.
